# DATA512 Homework 1

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to practice writing code that is reproducible. After reading the articles *Assessing Reproducibility* and *The Basic Reproducible Workflow Template* we are tasked with applying the knowledge we gained from the articles into a real world example.

## Project Description
For this project we use the WikiMedia REST API to gather data about pageviews for Wikipedia articles about dinosaurs and store this data as a json file. After the data is stored, we perform analysis on this data by creating three different visualizations using the data we gathered

## Project Files
The JSON files created by this project are listed below:
- dino_monthly_desktop_201507-202209.json
  - Data for each dinosaur by month for desktop access
- dino_monthly_mobile_201507-202209.json
  - Data for each dinosaur by month for mobile access. This includes both mobile app and mobile web access
- dino_monthly_cumulative_201507-202209.json
  - Data for each dinosaur by month for all access types
  
*Note:* When collecting the data if there exists a dinosaur that has no article views between the given time period that article title is ommited from the final json file
  
 The graphs outputted by this project are shown below:
